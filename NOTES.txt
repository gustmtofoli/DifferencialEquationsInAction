- Motion of the Moon around Earth:
2*pi*t / 27 days

- Derivative gives the local rate of change
v(t) = dx(t)/dt = x'(t)

- acceleration is the second derivate of v/t

- Newton's Law of gravitation:
G*(m1 * m2)/d2
G = 6.67*10^-11 Nm²/Kg

- Moon_gravity ~ 1/6*Earth_gravity = 1.62 m/s²
- Moon ratio = 1.737*10^6 m
